# Project Travel Bot

Welcome to the Travel Bot project! This is an AI-powered chatbot that helps users find real-time weather updates and offers a conversational experience related to travel destinations.

## Features

- **Weather Updates**: The bot fetches real-time weather information for specified locations.
- **Interactive Conversations**: The bot supports conversational engagement, including mood-based responses and general greetings.
- **User-Friendly**: With simple commands, the bot provides relevant information and responses.

## Technologies Used

- **Rasa**: An open-source machine learning framework for automated text and voice-based conversations.
- **Python**: Programming language for the core logic of the bot.
- **APIs**: The bot uses the OpenWeather API to fetch live weather data.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaborative platform to manage the codebase.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karkra911/project-travel-bot.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the API Key**:
   For weather updates, you need to set up an API key. Get your key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and add it to your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export WEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   ```

4. **Train the model**:
   Train the Rasa model by running:
   ```bash
   rasa train
   ```

5. **Run the bot**:
   Start the Rasa server with:
   ```bash
   rasa run
   ```

6. **Chat with the bot**:
   To interact with the bot, use:
   ```bash
   rasa shell
   ```
